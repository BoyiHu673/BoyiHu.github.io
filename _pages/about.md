Hello and welcome!

I am a postdoctoral research scientist in biostatistics at Columbia University in the City of New York, where I work with [Dr. Yuanjia Wang](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/yuanjia-wang-phd) and [Dr. Annie J. Lee](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/annie-j-lee-phd). I got my PhD from the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University, under the supervision of [Dr. Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical and methodological aspects of statistics and machine learning. My current research focuses on methodological challenges motivated by neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, I develop novel statistical and machine learning approaches to characterize disease heterogeneity—such as in Alzheimer’s disease—by integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data with longitudinal clinical trajectories. More recently, I have also developed a strong interest in causal inference.
